Summary

This project predicts house prices in Delhi using machine learning techniques. It analyzes property features like location, area, and number of bedrooms to understand price trends and build an accurate prediction model.

🎯 Problem Statement

To develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict house prices in Delhi based on various property features and identify the key factors influencing price variation.

🧹 Data Wrangling

Removed missing and duplicate values

Converted categorical features (location, furnishing status) into numerical format

Standardized column names

Handled outliers in price and area

Feature selection based on correlation analysis

📊 Data Visualization

Price distribution histogram

Correlation heatmap

Location-wise average price comparison

BHK vs Price analysis

Area vs Price scatter plot

🚀 Conclusion

Location and property size (square feet) are the most significant factors affecting house prices in Delhi. Among tested models, Random Forest provided better prediction accuracy compared to basic Linear Regression.
